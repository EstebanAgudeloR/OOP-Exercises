Overview

This repository gathers exercises in Java and Python focused on practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, methods, encapsulation, and modularity.

The exercises were developed using NetBeans and Google Colab, and organized with GitHub version control to document the learning process and make it easier to review and track progress.

Purpose

The goal is to strengthen skills in programming logic and apply good development practices, building a solid foundation for tackling more complex projects in the future.
